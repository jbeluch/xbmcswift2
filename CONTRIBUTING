First of all, thanks!

Here are a few guidelines to help you on your way:

1. Fork the repo. Typically patches should be based on the develop branch
   rather than master. Merges into master are reserved for releases.

2. Run tests from the root of the directory with `python -m unittest discover`.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!

4. Make the tests pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.


To test your changes to xbmcswift2 within XBMC, you can use `fab
local_release:eden`. This will create a local copy of XBMC specific
distribution of xbmcswift2. You can then copy this folder into your
~/.xbmc/addons folder.

Syntax should follow pep8 guidelines wherever possible.
