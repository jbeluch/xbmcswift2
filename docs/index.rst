   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to XBMC Swift's documentation!
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for xbmcswift2. This documentation is divided into
several parts. If you are new, you should start with the :ref:`installation`
and then move on to :ref:`quickstart`. If you would prefer a more detailed
walkthrough, try the :ref:`tutorial`.

To get a deeper understanding of xbmcswift2, check out :ref:`routing`,
:ref:`caching` and the complete :ref:`api` reference. For specific code
samples, check out :ref:`patterns`. If you are upgrading from xbmcswift, check
out the :ref:`upgrading` page.

xbmcswift2 doesn't rely on any external dependencies to get started. However,
when writing plugins I like to use http://BeautifulSoup.org. Also, when it
comes to advanced testing of plugins, I like to use http://nosetests.org.

For a list of XBMC addons which use xbmcswift2, see :ref:`poweredby`.
